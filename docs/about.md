# estios: Economic Spatial Temporal and Input-Output Systems

This package has been created as part of the [Input-output analytics for urban systems: experiments in history and planning](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/input-output-analytics-urban-systems) project at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/).

The foundational methods upon which this package is built are Leontief’s input-output analysis and Wilson’s family of spatial interaction models. It is the combination of the two which facilitates the creation of a mathematical model of trade flows on a regional level.

Input-output analysis
– made famous by Wassily Leontief in the mid-twentieth century
– provides a framework for examining inter-dependencies between sectors in an economy.
By examining the technical relationships, the method provides a way of considering not just the final output of an economic sector, but also the goods and services used to create other goods and/or services before they are sold to consumers.

The Wilsonian family of spatial interaction models are ways of predicting movements between sets of origins and destinations within a system. They not only account for the distances between origin-destination pairs, but also incorporate the factors which might make one destination more attractive than another.
