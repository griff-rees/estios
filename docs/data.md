Infrastucture within the `estios.utils` is detailed below with examples from the United Kingdom, primarily contemporaneous but with a historical example as well.

The following data are provided by the [ONS](https://www.ons.gov.uk/)
and it's partner institution [Nomis](https://www.nomisweb.co.uk) run by the [Univerity of Durham](https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/home/about.asp) under the [Open Government Licence v3.0 (OGL)](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/). which encourages the user to 'copy, publish, distribute and transmit' information as appropriate.
